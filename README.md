User Engagement: Measured average watch hours, content preferences (movies vs. series), and the impact of personalized recommendations on user activity. Demographics & Behavior: Analyzed genre preferences by age group, device usage trends, and peak viewing hours (morning, evening, late night) to optimize content delivery and user targeting. Retention & Loyalty: Evaluated user status (active vs. inactive), loyalty point usage, login frequency, and download behavior to understand long-term engagement and churn risk. Regional & Payment Insights: Explored preferred payment methods and subscription trends by region and country. Analyzed language preferences and their impact on engagement to support content localization efforts. The analysis enabled strategic improvements in user retention, content personalization, regional targeting, and revenue optimization by aligning offerings with user needs and behaviors.
